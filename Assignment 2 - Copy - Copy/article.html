                Kylian Mbappé had his best night so far in a Real Madrid shirt on Wednesday as his hat-trick propelled Los Blancos to a 3-1 win – 6-3 on aggregate – over Manchester City and into the Champions League round of 16.
                
                The French superstar was in devastating form, converting a delicate lob, a skillful individual run and a thumping left-foot drive to decisively prove that his slow start in Madrid has well and truly come to an end.
                
                "It's brilliant. You go into games knowing he's going to affect games," teammate Jude Bellingham told TNT Sports. "You know when Kylian gets the ball in areas that he likes to get the ball, he's going to be dangerous. Right foot, left foot – you saw the different kinds of goals today.</p><br>
            <p>"It's incredible, really, what he's done in his career. I know he had a slow start and he was kind of getting used to life here, but now he's just flying and it's a pleasure to watch."

                With Madrid 3-2 up on aggregate after the first leg in Manchester, it took just four minutes for the 26-year-old to open the scoring at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, as he got on the end of a long ball over the top by Raúl Asencio and lifted his shot over onrushing City goalkeeper Ederson.</p><br>
            <p>The emotions of the Real Madrid players could not have been more in contrast with those of their City counterparts. The 2022-23 European champion is floundering, this being its earliest exit from the competition since 2012, and the first time that manager Pep Guardiola has ever been eliminated from the tournament before the round of 16.

                "It's a fantastic team," he said of Madrid in an interview with TNT Sports. "We just congratulate them, they deserve to go through. We didn't deserve (it). It's the first year we didn't make a good Champions League season.
                
                "We have to accept that right now, this season, we are not close enough to be there, and we'll see what happens in the future."</p>
