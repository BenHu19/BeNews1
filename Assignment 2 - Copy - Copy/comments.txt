<!-- Since I choose to make news website, in this index.html file will be for the news briefing page.
 As required, there will be navbar using nav tag, where it utilize fontawesome icons for hamburger toggle and 
 magnifying glass. For layout, as specify there are combination of both grid and flexbox, also
 in total for this page I use 1 hero image, 4 medium images, 4 small images, and the logo.
 The structure of page include navbar, header, main contents (sections and articles), and footer. -->

<!-- For the layout, there 2 main separation, first is for the hero grid, then the main-content.
 For hero grid, I basically use grid to separate hero div and stacking small images on the side
 using flex and making it turn from flex-direction column initially to row when screen get resized.
 Thus, I'm not leaving much empty spaces on the sides of the hero image and maintain the page
 responsiveness. For main-content, I included 4 medium size images in a repeat defined grid
 with autofit and minmax feature so it remain responsive as well. -->

 <!-- In article.html, essentially I structured the page very similar to index. The page is intented for the specified
 news article where user pick to read. Layouts are similar, in fact, I reuse the hero grid styling from index applied here,
 to allign with requirements of total images included and maintain responsiveness. Though, for now there's only one article 
 for every news page linked with which is its main limitation.-->

 <!-- Overall, it's very much alike in structures and layouts to index.html, though I will say it's definitely
 not my best work, I get very annoyed when often times I find there are empty spaces that just pop out of nowhere.
 I don't know why! but I do my best to ensure everything fits with requirements. -->
